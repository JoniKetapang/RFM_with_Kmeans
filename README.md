# RFM with Kmeans

In this Jupyter Notebook project, we embark on a data-driven journey to decipher customer behavior using the RFM framework (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary) with the powerful aid of K-means clustering. By combining these two methodologies, we aim to gain a profound understanding of customer segments, enabling businesses to tailor their strategies effectively.

* Understanding RFM Framework:
The RFM framework is a strategic tool used to segment customers based on three critical dimensions:

1. Recency (R): This reflects how recently a customer made a purchase. Customers who've engaged recently are often more likely to respond to offers or engage in new products or services.
2. Frequency (F): This represents how often a customer makes a purchase. High-frequency customers may indicate loyalty or a strong affinity for the brand.
3. Monetary Value (M): This measures the amount of money a customer spends. High monetary value customers are crucial for generating significant revenue.

Leveraging K-means Clustering:
K-means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that helps us discover hidden patterns in data by grouping similar observations into clusters. We'll apply K-means to our RFM dataset to segment customers with similar behaviors, aiding personalized marketing efforts.
